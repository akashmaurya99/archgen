  AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md pointer blocks), `archgen install` / `--uninstall`
  (multi-harness global installer with manifest-recorded removal).
- **VS Code extension** (`packages/extension`): DAG view, code-graph view,
  docs view, and build button over `.archgen/` artifacts.
- Multi-harness support: Claude Code, agentskills.io generic layout, OpenCode,
  Cursor, GitHub Copilot (project-local), plus `install.sh` symlink/copy
  installer with uninstall manifest.
